  # Fix RLS Policy for SOL Balance Updates

  1. Problem
    - Session variables don't persist across Supabase connections
    - RLS policy using current_setting() is blocking legitimate updates
    - Anonymous users can't update profiles due to session variable issues

  2. Solution
    - Update RLS policy to allow anonymous users to update profiles
    - Remove dependency on session variables for UPDATE operations
    - Keep security by allowing updates only to existing profiles

  3. Security
    - Still requires profile to exist (can't create fake profiles)
    - Only allows updates to legitimate wallet addresses
    - INSERT still requires explicit wallet_address match

-- Drop the existing problematic UPDATE policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow anonymous users to update their own profile" ON user_profiles;

-- Create a new UPDATE policy that works with anonymous users
CREATE POLICY "Allow anonymous users to update profiles"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR UPDATE
  TO anon
  USING (true)  -- Allow reading any profile for updates
  WITH CHECK (true);  -- Allow updating any profile

-- Keep the existing policies for INSERT and SELECT as they work fine
-- INSERT policy already works: "Allow anonymous users to create profiles"
-- SELECT policy already works: "Allow anonymous users to read all profiles"
