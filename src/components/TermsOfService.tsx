              <p>
                Pump Pumpkin provides a decentralized trading platform that enables users to engage in leveraged trading of digital assets, specifically tokens created on the Pump.fun platform. The Service allows users to open leveraged positions with various multipliers, subject to market conditions and platform limitations. The Company acts solely as a technology provider and does not provide investment advice, financial planning services, or recommendations regarding specific trading strategies.

              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">3. FEES AND CHARGES</h2>
              <p>
                The Company charges a flat fee of zero point three percent (0.3%) on all trades executed through the platform. This fee is calculated based on the total trade value and is automatically deducted from your account at the time of trade execution. The fee applies to both opening and closing positions, regardless of trade size, leverage multiplier, or asset type. Additional fees may apply for specific services including but not limited to: overnight funding charges, liquidation fees, withdrawal fees, and premium feature access fees.
              </p>
              <p>
                All fees are clearly disclosed on the platform interface prior to trade execution. Fee structures may be modified at the Company's sole discretion with thirty (30) days written notice to users. Users are responsible for understanding all applicable fees before executing trades. The Company reserves the right to implement additional fee categories or modify existing fee structures to reflect changes in operational costs, regulatory requirements, or market conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fees are non-refundable except in cases of documented system errors or technical malfunctions directly attributable to the Company's platform. Users acknowledge that fees are separate from any gains or losses on trading positions and that fee payments do not guarantee trading success or platform performance. The Company may offer fee discounts or rebates at its discretion based on trading volume, account tenure, or promotional programs, but such benefits may be modified or terminated without prior notice.

              <p>
                Trading in digital assets, particularly with leverage, involves substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for all investors. The value of digital assets can be extremely volatile and unpredictable. Leveraged trading amplifies both potential gains and losses, and you may lose more than your initial investment. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You acknowledge and agree that you understand these risks and that you are solely responsible for determining whether leveraged trading is appropriate for your financial situation and risk tolerance.
              </p>
              <p>
                You further acknowledge that digital assets are subject to various risks including but not limited to: market volatility, liquidity risks, technology risks, regulatory risks, and operational risks. The Company makes no representations or warranties regarding the future performance of any digital assets or trading strategies.
